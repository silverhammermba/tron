This is a 2-4 player game inspired by the light cycle battles in TRON, played in
a terminal.

Aside from being a fun multiplayer game, this servers as a testing bed for two
Ruby modules I am working on: a replacement for the Curses module in Ruby's
standard library, and my rewrite of Claudio Fiorini's RJoystick gem.

Due to its module dependencies, the game only works on Linux. I have no plans
for other platforms at the moment.
